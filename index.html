		<h2>First Impressions</h2>
		<p>As you can probably tell, our class went to a trip to Archer Malmo to see how things are done. When I walked into the building, I was thrown for a loop when I saw the Cotton Museum. Personally, I feel that sharing a building for two separate purposes, is a big no-no. I liked how the lobby was decorated for the holidays. Having people show up to the building during the trip was great for showing the laxed nature of this kind of job.</p>

		<h2>Their Presentation</h2>
		<p>I liked their presentation for the most part. Halfway through I got antsy since we were sitting there for at least 2 and half hours. Having people show up during the the presentation helped with the idea of autonomy. Personally I like the idea of autonomy but it seems kind of nerve-racking. When we finished the presentation, we took a group hastily put together group photo where I'm barely visible.</p>

		<h2>Building Tour</h2>
		<p>After the presentation, we split up into two groups to get a tour of the building. This is where the shared building issue really shows its face. We only had to go 4 separate floors, but each one was separated by one or two un-associated businesses. Since we took the stairs, things were more tedious than it needed to be. I also learned that Archer Malmo also did commercials and had a recording room.</p>

		<h2>Lunch</h2>
		<p>I had never been to cookout before so I was nervous about the food. I ordered the Cookout Tray and got a Plain Cheese Burger, Double-Up of Fries, and a Dr. Pepper. When I took that first bite, I was shocked at how good it was. I was so impresses that as soon as my mom got home I told her about the food. I asked if she would be open the getting me some more in the days to come. I rate Cookout 5 out of 5 Stars for the meal I had.</p>
